# Research reveals MCP is UNSUITABLE for Parseltongue

## Token Inefficiency:
- **MCP**: 52,000 tokens for basic debugging
- **CLI**: 1,200 tokens for same task
- **43× worse** - directly contradicts Parseltongue's "99% token reduction" value proposition

## Performance:
- **MCP**: 60/100 developer efficiency score
- **CLI**: 77/100 (28% better)
- Lacks Unix composability

## Market Reality:
- Growing adoption (5,867+ servers) BUT primarily for rapid prototyping
- Production use cases favor REST/CLI
- Top engineers ditching MCP for efficiency

## Recommendation:
**DROP MCP from v1.6** (was PMF 95, now N/A). Focus on existing HTTP REST API + CLI enhancements.
