## 6. LLM Context Optimization

### "Give me focused context for working on X within token budget"
```bash
# 4K token budget for working on storage
curl "http://localhost:7777/smart-context-token-budget?focus=rust:fn:storage:path:1-50&tokens=4000"

# 8K token budget for working on parsing
curl "http://localhost:7777/smart-context-token-budget?focus=rust:struct:Parser:path:1-100&tokens=8000"
```
**Sample Questions Answered**:
- What context do I need to understand this function?
- What's the minimal set of code to include for this task?
- How do I stay under token limits while getting full context?

### "What's the most relevant code for understanding X?"
```bash
curl "http://localhost:7777/smart-context-token-budget?focus=ENTITY_KEY&tokens=2000"
```
**The Killer Feature**: Returns prioritized context:
1. The focus entity itself
2. Direct dependencies (callees)
3. Direct callers
4. Transitive dependencies (if budget allows)

## 7. Dependency Graph Exploration

### "What does the `unknown:0-0` pattern mean?"
External/stdlib function calls appear as:
- `rust:fn:new:unknown:0-0` → `HashMap::new()`, `Vec::new()`
- `rust:fn:unwrap:unknown:0-0` → `.unwrap()` calls
- `rust:fn:expect:unknown:0-0` → `.expect()` calls
- `rust:fn:clone:unknown:0-0` → `.clone()` calls

These represent calls to standard library or external crate functions that aren't defined in your codebase.

### "What's the ISGL1 key format?"
```
language:type:name:path:start_line-end_line
```
Examples:
- `rust:fn:main:crates/cli/src/main.rs:8-45` (function)
- `rust:struct:Parser:crates/core/src/parser.rs:10-25` (struct)
- `rust:method:new:crates/core/src/storage.rs:38-54` (method)
- `rust:impl:Storage:crates/core/src/storage.rs:56-200` (impl block)

## 8. Developer Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I'm new to this codebase. Where do I start?"
```bash
# 1. Get overview
curl http://localhost:7777/codebase-statistics-overview-summary

# 2. Find main entry points
curl "http://localhost:7777/code-entities-search-fuzzy?q=main"

# 3. See what main calls
curl "http://localhost:7777/forward-callees-query-graph?entity=rust:fn:main:..."

# 4. Find complexity hotspots
curl "http://localhost:7777/complexity-hotspots-ranking-view?top=10"
```

### Scenario 2: "I need to modify the storage layer. What's the impact?"
```bash
# 1. Find storage entities
curl "http://localhost:7777/code-entities-search-fuzzy?q=storage"

# 2. Get blast radius for the main storage struct
curl "http://localhost:7777/blast-radius-impact-analysis?entity=rust:struct:CozoDbStorage:...&hops=3"

# 3. Get smart context for editing
curl "http://localhost:7777/smart-context-token-budget?focus=rust:struct:CozoDbStorage:...&tokens=8000"
```

### Scenario 3: "Is it safe to refactor this function?"
```bash
# 1. Check who calls it (reverse deps)
curl "http://localhost:7777/reverse-callers-query-graph?entity=FUNCTION_KEY"

# 2. Check blast radius
curl "http://localhost:7777/blast-radius-impact-analysis?entity=FUNCTION_KEY&hops=2"

# 3. If few callers and small blast radius → safe to refactor
```

### Scenario 4: "I found a bug in X. What tests cover it?"
```bash
# 1. Get codebase stats to see test count
curl http://localhost:7777/codebase-statistics-overview-summary

# 2. Search for test entities
curl "http://localhost:7777/code-entities-search-fuzzy?q=test"

# 3. Check reverse callers to find test coverage
curl "http://localhost:7777/reverse-callers-query-graph?entity=BUGGY_FUNCTION"
```

### Scenario 5: "Prepare context for LLM code review"
```bash
# 1. Get focused context within token budget
curl "http://localhost:7777/smart-context-token-budget?focus=FILE_ENTITY&tokens=4000"

# 2. Include the response in your LLM prompt
# Result: 99% token reduction vs dumping raw files
```
